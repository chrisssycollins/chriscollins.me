### Photography/Photo Editing

- [MetaImage](https://neededapps.com/metaimage/) - Clean and efficient way to edit photo metadata.
- [Renamer](https://renamer.com/) - I have a couple of presets set up to organise my photos based on the metadata timestamps.

  - [Google Chrome](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome) - Temporarily back using Chrome because Firefox has reset to default settings twice in a month.
- [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) - I'm not a 10x Developer...but ohmyzsh makes me feel like one.
- [Kap](https://getkap.co/) - Screen recorder of choice, can't believe this is a free app.
- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) - Used to use [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) but Rectangle is the open-source maintained fork of it.

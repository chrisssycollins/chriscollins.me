## At work:
- Re-writing the main web UI to be lean, fast and progressively enhanced. 
- Re-writing API endpoints for a new build of a mobile app.

## In life:

- Cycling again. 
- Planning to climb again after April 26th, when Scottish lockdown restrictions end. 

## For fun:
- Building outdoor things for my son out of wood.

## At work:
- Re-writing mobile apps to use Swift and Swift UI on iOS and TWA on Android. 
- Archiving decades worth of news content but keeping it all publically accessible for historic reference. 
- Migrating our full stack over to AWS. 

## In life:
- Iâ€™ve been doing a lot of cycling since March (lockdown) and I really want/need to keep this up over winter. I'm averaging around 80-100km a week. 
- Preparing to move house in October after a hefty delay in the process. 

## Reading:
- I'm currently reading [Endurance by Captain Louis Rudd](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Endurance-Soldier-Adventurer-Decorated-Leader/dp/1529031737). 
- Signed up for [Readly](https://readly.com) and really enjoying dipping in and out of magazines.

## For fun:

- Building a single speed bike.
- Converting all my family VHS tapes over to digital.

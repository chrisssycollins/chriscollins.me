## At work:
- Re-writing mobile apps to use Swift and Swift UI on iOS and TWA on Android. 
- Archiving decades worth of news content but keeping it all publically accessible for historic reference. 
- Optimising loads of complex WordPress queries to squeeze some ms off them.
- Trying to get my head around IAB v2 and the dodgy world of cookies. 
- Building a bespoke static site boilerplate/workflow for a small team to help them kickstart their client projects. It's my first project where the client has specifically asked for Eleventy. Woohoo! 

## In life:
- Iâ€™ve been doing a lot of cycling since March (lockdown) and I really want/need to keep this up over winter. I'm averaging around 80-100km a week. 
- About to join Zwift.
- Preparing to move house in October after a hefty delay in the process. 

## Reading:
- I'm currently reading [Endurance by Captain Louis Rudd](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Endurance-Soldier-Adventurer-Decorated-Leader/dp/1529031737). 
- Signed up for [Readly](https://readly.com) and really enjoying dipping in and out of magazines.

## For fun:

- Building a single speed bike.
- Converting all my family VHS tapes over to digital.

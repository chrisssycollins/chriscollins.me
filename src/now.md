## At work:
- Re-writing mobile apps to use Swift and Swift UI on iOS and TWA on Android. 
- Trying to get my head around IAB v2 and the dodgy world of cookies. 
- Building a completely new website for a digital signage and animation company that works closely with Formula 1. 

## In life:
- Got my Wahoo Kickr set up and embarking on the world of Zwift.
- Decorating, laying flooring and general new home chores.
- Planning some winter climbing once the lockdown is lifted.

## For fun:
- Setting up my garage as a man cave for all my hiking, cycling gear and tools. 
- Converting all my family VHS tapes over to digital.

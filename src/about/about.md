# About

I'm Chris, a UX Designer/Engineer currently based in Glasgow, Scotland. At present I work at Arnold Clark, a large automotive company based in Scotland. 

I began writing code at 9 years old; with the solid help of Geocities, Dreamweaver, and a lot of copy and paste. This is ultimately where my web journey began and I'm still on the trip, still learning every day. 
 
I am a passionate supporter of the open web and care deeply about user experience, digital privacy and the inclusion of every single person on the web. 

Away from a computer you’ll find me taking photos around Scotland or up a mountain. See my [hiking log](/log) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/scottishstoater) for photos.

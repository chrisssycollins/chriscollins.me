# Privacy Policy

I respect the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and this policy document explains how I collect and handle any information you provide me.

## What background data is collected?

This website does not collect or store any personally identifiable data behind the scenes. It does not set any cookies and it does not use any third-party hosted tracking scripts.

## How do I use the data you provide?

If you sign up for my newsletter, I only collect your name and email address.  
If you use the contact form I will use the data you provide to correspond with you.  
This website does not collect anymore information.   

## Where do I store your data?

If you sign up for my newsletter, I store your name and email address in [Mailchimp](https://www.mailchimp.com).  
When you contact me directly by email the contents are stored in the email system, currently hosted on [zoho.eu](http://zoho.eu).  
If you use the contact form the data will be stored on within the form submission section on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), which only I have access to.

## How secure is my data?

Where I store your information in third-party services, access is restricted to myself.

The computer I use is protected by passcode access. This computer asks for authentication whenever it’s started or after 5 minutes of inactivity. My mobile device is also protected by a face recognition.

## How secure is this website?

This website transmits itself using HTTPS, encrypting all data between the browser and the server. Your network provider may still be able to see that you are loading files from this site, but not their content. This also protects you from third parties intercepting data e.g. while browsing on public WiFi, or network providers injecting ads into this site.

## Webmentions

This website implements [Webmentions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmention), a form of content interaction on the web. Other systems may send webmentions to this site, whenever a resource (like an article or note)
on this website is linked to. This includes:

- Content published on other blogs that contain such a link
- Tweets published on Twitter that contain such a link
- Replies and comments made on a tweet that contains such a link

Incoming webmentions are handled as a request to comment on a piece of content,
and can be included on this website. A webmention can include your
personal data, provided you have made that data publicly visible on your website or social media profile. Webmentions can include:

- Your username (may be your real name)
- Your profile picture
- The webmention source URL (may be your own site or a tweet)
- The content of your comment or reply

The processing of incoming Webmentions is based on the legitimate interest
to enable interaction with the readers of this website (Art. 6(1) lit. f GDPR), following the design intention of the Webmention protocol.

If your personal data was published in a webmention, you may at any time
demand the removal of it from this website. To do so, please [notify me](mailto:hello@chriscollins.me)
and point me to the entry in question.

## Changes to the policy

If I change the contents of this policy, those changes will become effective the moment I publish them on my website.

## Complaints

If you’ve any reason to complain about the ways I handle your privacy, please contact me (Chris Collins) by email at [hello@chriscollins.me](mailto:hello@chriscollins.me).

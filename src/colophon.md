This website is built using [Eleventy](https://11ty.io) and my trusted boilerplate, [JAMStack Web Starter](https://github.com/scottishstoater/jamstack-web-starter/).

The full source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/scottishstoater/chriscollins.me) and the full site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

Most pages and posts are written in basic Markdown.

I maintain the site code using Visual Studio Code paired with the fantastic [Gatito Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pawelgrzybek.gatito-theme) by [Pawel Grzybek](https://pawelgrzybek.com/).

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used for styling. 

The design of the site is heavily influenced by [Matthew Smiths](https://matthewsmith.website/) elegant website that I felt completely embraced the web rather than fight it. I found this refreshing.

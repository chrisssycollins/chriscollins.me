I started my job at STV in early November 2019. I snapped these photos with my phone while I was wandering to work during [golden hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_hour_(photography)). The [Clyde Arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Arc) and [Finnieston Crane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnieston_Crane) make [Pacific Quay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Quay) look great!

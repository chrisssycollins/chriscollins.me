## [Native image lazy-loading for the web! ‚≠ê](https://addyosmani.com/blog/lazy-loading/)

Any performance focused web designer or developer will be over the moon at a blog post by Addy Osmani about an upcoming native lazy loading tag, that can be added to any `<img>` and `<iframe>` tag. 

Imagine üöÄ‚Ä¶ 

```html
<img src="/cat.gif" lazy="true" />
```

The article explains the stage in which the implementation is at and provides some details about fallbacks. This is a much-needed feature of browsers, especially for mobile users.  

## [Daily - Curated Dev News](https://www.dailynow.co/)

I‚Äôve been using my Chrome new tab page as a glorified RSS reader for a while now with [Muzli](https://muz.li/), which is predominately aimed at designers. [Back in 2016 Invision bought Muzli](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/invision-muzli/) and since then I personally feel it‚Äôs turned primarily into a tool to promote Invision and their suite of products. 

I stumbled across Daily in April and haven‚Äôt looked back. It‚Äôs like Muzli but with more development related news and free of any promo stuff, so far. Give it a go! 

## [Editor.js - Block style editor](https://editorjs.io/)

Imagine you could ask a user for data using a wide range of inputs (that you control) and then take that data and export it as extremely clean and self-documenting JSON - that‚Äôs Editor.js. 

For example: If a user enters a list

- List item 1 
- List item 2 
- List item 3
  
Editor.js will spit out a self-describing object of its contents and state.

```son
{
    "type" : "list",
    "data" : {
        "style" : "unordered",
        "items" : [
            "List item 1",
            "List item 2",
            "List item 3"
        ]
    }
}
```

You can then take that JSON, store it and retrieve and use it in any modern language or stack.

I‚Äôve never used it but I think I will in the near future.


## [Public Sans - an open source font by the US GOV](https://github.com/uswds/public-sans)

Public Sans is a free, open font (available in weights from 100-900) from the federal United States Web Design System with a [Github project](https://github.com/uswds/public-sans) that you can contribute to. It's described as: ‚ÄúA strong, neutral typeface for text or display."

Being from the UK I‚Äôve followed the design of [GOV.UK‚Äôs open source design system (GDS)](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) and their pioneering approach to implementing accessibility and inclusive design. Seeing another major government body providing the world with open design assets is a massive step in the right direction.

I stumbled across the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) movement late last year during a work/life burnout period and it's safe to say it was a godsend that has reignited my love for the web. I spend a lot of my time working on commercial enterprise applications and had lost touch with maintaining a personal space on the web. I'm back and I'm loving it!

I read about Webmentions briefly last year but never really gave it much consideration. I had a second wind after seeing [Max BÃ¶ck](https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/) implement them so beautifully on his site and [Andy Bell](https://andy-bell.design/wrote/adding-webmentions-to-my-personal-site/) providing a single [PR](https://github.com/andybelldesign/personal-site-hylia/pull/2) documenting how he implemented it.

It's still a bit rough around the edges but it works. My setup doesn't differ too much from Andy's ~~except I'm using `liquid` for my templating~~.

title: About
---

I'm a software engineer, okay-ish designer, and photo taker living in Glasgow, Scotland. 

I work at [STV News](https://news.stv.tv), where I build and maintain digital products alongside the editorial team. Previously, I was a UX Engineer at [Arnold Clark](https://www.arnoldclark.com) and a Web Developer at [Ultralinx](https://theultralinx.com).

I began writing code at 9 years old; with the solid help of Geocities, Dreamweaver, and a lot of copy and paste. This is ultimately where my coding journey began and I'm still on the trip, still learning every day.

I am a passionate supporter and believer in the open web. I care deeply about great user experiences, digital privacy and the inclusion of every person using the web.

Away from a computer youâ€™ll find me taking photos around Scotland, up a mountain or cycling. See my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/scottishstoater) for photos.

    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>I'm Chris, a Coder, Designer and wannabe Photographer currently based in Glasgow, Scotland. I work at <a href="https://news.stv.tv">STV News</a> - a media and news company in Scotland - building digital products alongside the news team. Previously, I was a UX Engineer at Arnold Clark and a Web Developer at Ultralinx. </p>
    <p>I began writing code at 9 years old; with the solid help of Geocities, Dreamweaver, and a lot of copy and paste. This is ultimately where my coding journey began and I'm still on the trip, still learning every day.</p> 
    <p>I am a passionate supporter and believer in the open web. I care deeply about great user experiences, digital privacy and the inclusion of every person using the web.</p>
    <p>Away from a computer youâ€™ll find me taking photos around Scotland, up a mountain or cycling. See my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/scottishstoater">Instagram for photos</a>. </p>
